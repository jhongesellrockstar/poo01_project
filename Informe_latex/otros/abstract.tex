This report presents \textit{Patitas Seguras}, a desktop application built in the Object-Oriented Programming course to consolidate animal abuse alerts, blacklists for veterinary clinics, adoption notices, and a community-driven ranking of veterinary services in Lima and Callao (Peru). We modularized the solution and added a SQLite-based deployment to remove the dependency on corporate SQL servers. The document details the social motivation, regional background on animal welfare, system architecture, preliminary findings, and future work.
